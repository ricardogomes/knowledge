# December 2020


## Friday 18 

I'm restarting this project. It's been a very strange year and I need some structure to start 2021 with the best chance of it being a better year, so restarting my knowledge base seems to be a good way to end 2020 and get a jump start on 2021

I've moved the editing part of this projet to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as it strikes me as a very cool tool. It still keeps my notes locally on my repo so all the integrations like [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) should just keep working.
