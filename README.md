# Knowledge

## Introduction

All my public notes, thoughts, links and lists organized in a way that makes sense to me.

My main inspiration for this knowledge base was [Nikita Botolev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)'s repo, also called [knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) and the repos listed on [Richard Litt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)'s [Meta Knowledge](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme) repo.

The idea is to use this repo, and it's integration with GitBook, to write down the things I'm learning on my various areas of interest, and to keep some logs and lists for future review.

This wiki|repo uses these tools:

- ~~[vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) : vim plugin to create wikis easily.~~
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. 
- [github](https://github.com): code repository for both file management and to connect with the next tool
- [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/): website / "book" dynamicaly generated from the github repository

If you want to contribute to this repo you can, I'm not viewing this as a only me project, but as a way to curate knowledge. So do a PR for whatever you want to change or AMA with an issue.
